# Express API Lab

For this lab, you will be creating a backend for a completed frontend
application. You will be working on an app called "GAphy" which will display
a bunch of Gifs.

The frontend application has full CRUD functionality, your job is to create the
backend code to make it functional!

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory.
1. Fulfill the listed requirements.

Build out your backed in the `backend/` directory. You are required to turn in
your submission by making a pull request on the original repository.

## Requirements

You must create an API that runs at `http://localhost:3000/gifs`. You must have
a few different routes:

* GET `/gifs` which will list out all gifs
* POST `/gifs` which will add a new gif and return a list of all gifs
* PUT `gifs/:gifId` which will update a gif and redirect to the list of all gifs
* DELETE `gifs/:gifId` which will delete a gif and redirect to the list of all gifs

You should have your database set up to store a collection of gifs. Your model
should have two attributes:

* a `name` for the name of a gif
* a `url` for the url of the gif

If these are named differently, you will have to change the frontend!

You should also set up a seed file to load some default gifs into your database.
We recommend using the Giphy site to get gifs. Use the full URL that has the
`.gif` file extension (e.g.
"https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6ozBUuLfzTCngAFi/giphy.gif").

### Tips for Getting Started

* To start, you'll want to set up all your backend folders and files (think: `db` folder, `index.js` file, etc.).
* You'll also want to run `npm init` to create a `package.json` file to manage dependencies (e.g. `express`).
* Set up routes in a controller.
* Once you have your back end running on `http://localhost:3000/gifs`, open `index.html` on the front end to test your routes via the frontend buttons.

**You shouldn't need to edit the front-end code.** After testing your backend
and frontend together, you may have to modify and fix your backend.

## Bonus

* create a `/seed` route that will populate the database with at least 3 giphys
* Re-write the frontend in React.
* Add another model to the API.
